## Important Notes

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Intended for fresh installations**: This script is designed for new macOS installations without personal files. If you're running it on a device with existing personal files, **create a backup first** as some files may be deleted during the cleanup process.
- **Review before running**: Check the script contents to ensure the changes match your preferences
- **Automatic restarts**: The script will restart Finder and Dock to apply changes
- **Temporary files**: Downloads are stored in a temporary directory and cleaned up automatically

## Customization

The script is modular and easy to customize. Each section is clearly marked with comments. You can:

- Comment out sections you don't want to run
- Modify application lists
- Adjust animation speeds and timing
- Change Finder view preferences

## Troubleshooting

If an application fails to install:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the download URLs are still valid
3. Ensure you have sufficient disk space
4. Check the script output for specific error messages
